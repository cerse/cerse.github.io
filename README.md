# Community of Edinburgh RSEs

## Purpose

The aim is to establish a self sustaining *Community Edinburgh Research Software Engineers* (RSEs) who periodically come together to determine best practice, provide support for fellow RSEs in Edinburgh and wider afield. We are doing this through a number of meetings aimed to take place at regular intervals.

* Our [fifth meeting](https://cerse.github.io/2020-02-18-Grant-Institute/) was held at Grant Institute at the King's Buildings on 18/02/20.
* Our [fourth meeting](https://cerse.github.io/2019-10-08-ChancellorsBuilding/), was held at the Chancellor's Building in the BioQuarter on 08/10/19.
* Our [third meeting](https://cerse.github.io/2019-01-25-ArgyleHouse/) was held at Argyle House on 25/01/19.
* Our [second meeting](https://cerse.github.io/2018-11-21-ECA/) was held at the ECA on 21/11/18.
* Our [first meeting](https://cerse.github.io/2018-09-26-bootstrap/) was held at the Bayes Centre on 26/09/18.
