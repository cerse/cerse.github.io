# Community of Edinburgh RSEs

## Purpose

The aim is to establish a self-sustaining *Community of Edinburgh Research Software Engineers* (RSEs) who periodically come together to determine best practices and support fellow RSEs in Edinburgh and wider afield. We are doing this through several meetings aimed to take place at regular intervals.
