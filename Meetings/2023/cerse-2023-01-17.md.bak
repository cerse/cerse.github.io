## Notes

There are some possible fund available from the Society of RSEs.

Felicity is doing a PhD on what type of techniques RSEs should be using and what are they actually using. Felicity is keen to get empirical evidence from on-going research software projects. So want to know people that are doing software projects and get to know how they do it. Felcity is now an SSI Fellow. She will looking at the foundation of the Scottish RSE community - where do their skills come from and how they network. Sustainabilty of groups is of interest to her. Participatory workshop with the groups that underpin the Scottish RSE community. Get the organisers to share their experiences and what would facilitate their processes, basically the Scottish RSE Echo system.

Get volunteers to suggest a venue and co-host the next f2f meeting.

The new lecture theatre in the King's building and the new digital wall in central library as another venue.

Also try to get a sustainable community.

Later try to get other EdinburghInstitutions involved.
